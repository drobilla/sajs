Sajs
====

Sajs (Simple Api for JSon) is a minimal streaming JSON reader and writer,
implemented as a zero-dependency C99 library with a command-line wrapper.

Sajs is designed for minimal code size and flexibility of deployment.  The
library has no dependencies (not even the standard library), and requires only
a single contiguous chunk of memory which can be allocated statically.
